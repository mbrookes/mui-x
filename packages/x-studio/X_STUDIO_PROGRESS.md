## ✅ Completed

### D-01 · Multi-source relational data model

- Orders, order items (1–5 per order, 595 total), customers, products, shipments, shipment items, business metrics
- Deterministic PRNG-generated data (seeded, reproducible); scalable via `?rows=N` URL param
- Partially Delivered status for split shipments
- Declared relationships between sources (many-to-one and many-to-many)

### D-02 · Expression fields

- Calculated columns (per-row scalar values from an expression tree)
- Measures (single aggregate values over the filtered dataset)
- Expression field dialog for authoring
- Expression fields appear in all field pickers (chart, KPI, grid, filters)

### D-03 · Cross-source join projection

- Chart aggregations can use a y-field from a related source
- Join path resolved automatically via declared relationships
- Sparkline time-field can be sourced from a related table

### D-04 · Async / real data connector

- `StudioDataSourceAdapter` interface: `getRows(descriptor): Promise<StudioQueryResult>`
- `ref.setDataSourceAdapter(sourceId, adapter)` attaches/removes an adapter at runtime
- When an adapter is present Studio calls it instead of the in-memory rows pipeline
- `createSimpleAdapter` and `createBatchingAdapter` helper factories
- `isError` / `errorMessage` exposed from `useWidgetRows`; error UI shown in all widget types
- Demo `?adapter=true` mode routes all sources through a simulated server adapter
- See also: **A-09** (same underlying feature)

### D-05 · Pivot table widget

- `StudioPivotWidget` component with row field, column field, and value field pickers
- Collapsible row groups
- Export to CSV

### D-06 · Ad-hoc formula bar

- `InlineFormulaBar` component in `ChartSetupPanel` (after Y-series) and `KpiSetupPanel` (below value field)
- Pick two operands (fields or numeric constants), an operator (+/−/×/÷), and a label
- Calls `addExpressionField` so the expression field is immediately available in all pickers

### D-07 · Data lineage view

- `DataLineageGraph` SVG component in the data drawer
- Sources rendered as rounded-rect nodes in a responsive grid layout
- Relationships drawn as cubic Bézier edges with directional arrowheads
- Edge label badge shows cardinality (N:1, 1:1, N:M)
- Clicking an edge label opens a popover showing source/target, relationship type, and join key fields
- "Data lineage" collapsible section shown when 2+ sources exist

### DB-01 · Multi-page dashboard with theming

- Four pages: Overview, Products & Logistics, third page, Customers
- Per-page theme: background colour, card background/padding/radius/border
- Bookmarkable page tabs via `?page=` URL query param

### DB-02 · Page-level and widget-level filters

- Filters drawer with scope control (page vs. widget)
- Condition mode: all operators, compound AND/OR, relative dates
- Selection mode: multi-select chips with field value enumeration
- Rank mode: Top N / Bottom N with rank-by field

### DB-03 · Cross-filter

- Clicking a chart bar/slice or grid row emits a cross-filter to all other widgets
- Cross-filter scope is separate from user-defined page/widget filters
- Source widget is excluded from its own cross-filter

### DB-04 · Dashboard-level date range filter

- `StudioDateRangeBar` rendered above canvas
- Date/datetime field selector; preset toggle group (All time / YTD / This month / Last 3 months / Last 12 months)
- Creates a page-level `isDashboardDateRange` filter with the `between` operator
- Hidden from the filters drawer and quick-filter bar
- `computeDateRangePreset` exported for custom integrations

### DB-05 · Drill-down / detail panel

- `StudioDrilldownDrawer` slide-in panel
- `drilldownWidgetId` config on grid and chart widgets
- Clicking a chart item or grid row opens the drilldown with the clicked value as a filter
- Drilldown picker added to Interactions section in `ChartSetupPanel` and `GridSetupPanel`
- Context chips show the active filter

**Gaps:**

- Multi-level breadcrumb navigation deferred

### DB-06 · Customers page

- KPIs: Lifetime Value, Customer Count, Avg Order Value, Enterprise Customer Count
- Filter widgets: Segment toggle and Signup Date Range picker
- Charts: Acquisition Over Time, Revenue by Segment (donut), Top Customers (horizontal bar), Quarterly Revenue by Segment (stacked area)
- Grid: Top 20 customers by total revenue with order count

### DB-07 · Data refresh simulation

- **Refresh** toolbar button regenerates the demo dataset with a time-based seed (`Date.now()`)
- Calls `setDataSourceAdapter` (existing public API) for all 6 data sources with freshly generated rows
- KPIs, charts, and grids all re-render with the new data; existing widget config and filters are preserved

### DB-08 · State persistence (save/restore JSON)

- `ref.serializeState()` returns a JSON-safe `SerializedStudioState` snapshot
- `ref.loadSerializedState(data)` restores state and applies schema migrations
- Returns `MigrationResult` with `{ success, fromVersion, toVersion, errors }`
- Demo app provides Save (download JSON) and Load (upload JSON) toolbar buttons

- Single-series, multi-Y-series, and Split-by (seriesField) data shapes
- Auto-sizing axes; chart type picker with icons (vertical + horizontal variants)

### W-04a · Chart: `crossFilterMode` per widget

- `StudioCrossFilterMode = 'cross-highlight' | 'cross-filter' | 'none'`
- `'cross-highlight'` (default): shows full dataset as a faded ghost behind the filtered subset
- `'cross-filter'`: redraws chart using only the filtered rows (axes rescale)
- `'none'`: widget ignores all incoming cross-filters
- Configurable in the Chart Setup panel compose drawer

### W-05 · Scatter chart configuration

- `scatterColorField` config for categorical colour-by field
- Dedicated single Y-field picker for scatter in compose panel
- Optional colour-by field splits points into colour-coded series with legend

### W-09 · Gantt / timeline chart

- `gantt` chart type rendered by `StudioGanttChart` component
- Compose drawer: label field, start date field, end date field, optional colour-by category field
- Horizontal swimlane layout; bars span start→end date range
- Date axis, grid lines, tooltip showing label/dates/duration/category
- Overflows truncated with "+N more" notice

### W-10 · Heatmap

- `heatmap` chart type rendered by `StudioHeatmapChart` component
- Compose drawer: column-axis field, row-axis field, value/colour field
- Four colour schemes; `aggregateHeatmap()` sums value per (x, y) cell
- Per-cell tooltips showing exact values

**Gaps:**

- No custom colour-scale configuration (fixed sequential palettes only)

### C-12 · Visual expression builder

- Enhanced `StudioExpressionFieldDialog` with recursive nested function expressions
- `'Function'` kind added to input nodes enabling fully recursive expression trees
- Nested `ExpressionBuilder` rendered inline with collapsible sections and nesting-depth left-border indicators
- Dialog widened from `sm` → `md` to accommodate deep expression trees

### C-13 · Natural language widget creation

- `createWidgetFromDescription` function in `StudioChatPanel/`
- "Describe a widget" text field in compose drawer `AddWidgetView` (when `aiConfig` is set and `aiChat` feature flag enabled)

- Clear button; only shown when filters exist
- Shows "No matching filters." when a search query is active

### F-06 · Filter dependency (cascading)

- `dependsOn?: string[]` on `StudioFilterState`
- `useFieldValues` accepts `parentFilters` and pre-filters rows before extracting unique values
- Selection-mode page filters show a "Narrow options based on" multi-select Autocomplete to declare dependencies
- Options limited to other page filters with configured fields

### A-01–A-04 · Architecture

- `StudioController`: reactive `Store`, undo/redo stacks, serialization/migration
- `useSyncExternalStore`-based narrow selectors (per-widget re-render isolation)
- Deferred widget content render (single rAF batch after first paint)
- Memoized `StudioWidgetCard` and canvas rows
- Field capability system (type-derived, per-field overridable)
- `reselect`-based memoised selectors for expensive computed values

### A-05 · Embeddable SDK

- `StudioDashboard` component wrapping `Studio`
- Defaults to view-only mode (`compose: false`, `dataManagement: false`)
- `config` prop loads initial state and reloads when the reference changes
- `dataAdapters` prop auto-registers `StudioDataSourceAdapter` for each source ID on mount/change
- `featureFlags` merges on top of view-only defaults
- Exported from `@mui/x-studio`

### A-07 · AI chat assistant

- `StudioChatPanel` component with streaming message rendering
- `aiConfig` prop on `Studio`: `{ endpoint, apiKey?, model?, headers? }`
- Floating action button (bottom-right) opens/closes the panel; also available as a full-height slideout side panel
- Built-in tool suite: add/update/remove widget, set layout, navigate pages, manage filters
- `extraTools` prop on `StudioChatPanel` for custom tool extensions
- Empty-page prompt embeds the chat panel when a new page has no widgets yet
- `@mui/x-studio-server` middleware validates and routes LLM requests server-side

### A-08 · Slot props chain

- `Studio.slotProps.canvas` → forwarded to `StudioCanvas`
- `StudioCanvas.slotProps.widgetCard` → forwarded to every `StudioWidgetCard`
- `StudioWidgetCard.slotProps.{ paper, chart, grid, kpi, text, filter }` → forwarded to widget renderers

### A-09 · Async data source adapter interface

- `StudioDataSourceAdapter` interface: `getRows(descriptor): Promise<StudioQueryResult>`
- `ref.setDataSourceAdapter(sourceId, adapter)` attaches/removes an adapter at runtime
- See also: **D-04**

### A-10 · `@mui/x-studio-server` middleware package

- Framework-agnostic server handler: `handleBatchQuery(request, options)`
- `runPreflight` + `executeForTier` routing (`'client' | 'server' | 'db'`)
- `buildSecureQuery` prevents injection and enforces schema allowlist
- `LRUCacheProvider` for response caching; pluggable `CacheProvider` interface
- `extractSecurityClaims` for JWT/session-based row-level security

### A-11 · `sidebarLayout` + `sidebarSide` props

- `sidebarLayout?: 'stacked' | 'tabbed'` — stacked vs. single tab rail
- `sidebarSide?: 'left' | 'right'` — which side of the canvas the sidebar is anchored to
- `DrawerPanel` and `TabbedSidebar` receive `side` and flip borders + chevron direction accordingly

### A-12 · I18n / localisation support

- `StudioLocaleText` interface with 45 string tokens
- `DEFAULT_STUDIO_LOCALE_TEXT` English defaults
- `localeText?: Partial<StudioLocaleText>` prop on `Studio`, `StudioDashboard`, and `StudioProvider`
- `useStudioLocaleText()` hook; all hardcoded strings replaced in all Studio components
- `ptBRLocaleText` Brazilian Portuguese translation included
- All locale exports from `src/index.ts`

### A-13 · Feature flags

- `featureFlags` JSON object prop configures available features per deployment
- Controls visibility of compose/filter drawers, AI chat, and other capabilities
- Available for both `Studio` and `StudioDashboard` (composed apps)

### DB-09 · Shareable filter links

- Active page-filter values (operator, value, operator2, value2) encoded as `?fv=<base64-JSON>` in the URL
- Filter state syncs to the URL automatically (300 ms debounce) as filters change
- On page load, `?fv=` is decoded and patched into `INITIAL_STATE.filters` before the controller is constructed — no visual flash
- **Copy link** toolbar button copies `window.location.href` to clipboard; shows "Copied!" tooltip for 2 seconds
- Cross-filter and widget-scoped filters are excluded from the URL encoding

### UX-01 · Map aggregation disabled without value field

- Aggregation `Select` in `MapSetupPanel` is now `disabled` and forced to `'count'` when no value field is configured
- Becomes enabled as soon as a value field is picked

### UX-02 · Settings: Compose panel label

- Renamed "Compose / edit mode" → "Compose panel" in both `x-studio` and `x-studio-composed` `SettingsDialog.tsx`
- Does not affect the edit-mode toggle, which is a separate feature

### UX-03 · Data panel: right-aligned edit/delete

- Added `flexGrow: 1; minWidth: 0` to `ExpressionFieldRow` primary-content Stack so edit/delete icon buttons are always pushed to the right
- Added `flexShrink: 0` to relationship edit/delete `IconButton`s to prevent them overlapping long relationship names

### UX-04 · Consistent calculated field UI + feature flags (BL-78, BL-79)

- Replaced `InlineFormulaBar` in `ChartSetupPanel` and `KpiSetupPanel` with a "Calculated field…" button that opens the full `StudioExpressionFieldDialog`
- Added `onSaved?: (fieldId: string) => void` callback to `StudioExpressionFieldDialog` — called after a new field is created (not on edits); used by chart/KPI panels to auto-add the new field to the widget config
- All three widget types (chart, KPI, table) now use the identical full-featured expression dialog flow, consistent with the table benchmark
- New `StudioFeatureFlags` keys: `calculatedFields` (global master), `kpiCalculatedFields`, `chartCalculatedFields`, `gridCalculatedFields`; all default to `true`; each panel gates its "Calculated field…" control on `calculatedFields !== false && <widget>CalculatedFields !== false`
- Settings dialogs in both example apps expose the four new toggles; per-widget toggles have `parentKey: 'calculatedFields'` so they disable when the global master is off
- Fixed `Studio.tsx` variable ordering: `showCompose` declaration moved before the `useEffect` that references it

### UX-05 · Feature flags: relationships + widgetFilters (BL-86)

- Added `relationships` flag to `StudioFeatureFlags` — when `false`, hides the `RelationshipPanel` in `StudioDataDrawer`; `useStudioFeatures()` defaults it to `true`
- Added `widgetFilters` flag to `StudioFeatureFlags` — when `false`, hides the "Filters" tab in `StudioWidgetEditDialog` and re-indexes the "Format" tab accordingly; `useStudioFeatures()` defaults it to `true`
- Both settings dialogs (x-studio and x-studio-composed) expose the new toggles; `relationships` uses `parentKey: 'dataManagement'` so it disables when the data drawer is hidden

### INFRA-01 · fileUtils consolidated; stateToJson/jsonToState removed from public API (BL-91)

- Duplicate `downloadJson`/`uploadJson` helpers from both example apps moved to `examples/x-studio-shared/src/fileUtils.ts` and re-exported from the shared index
- Both example apps now import file helpers from `x-studio-shared` instead of maintaining local copies
- Removed `stateToJson` and `jsonToState` from `packages/x-studio` public API (`src/index.ts` + `src/store/statePersistence.ts`) — they were convenience wrappers (`serializeState + JSON.stringify` and inverse) that were unused; consumers use `serializeState`/`deserializeState` + `loadSerializedState` through the controller directly

### INFRA-02 · Pipeline benchmark results (BL-89)

- Ran `pnpm --filter "@mui/x-studio" bench` (50 iterations, 5 warmup, Apple M2)
- Results saved in `packages/x-studio/PERF_RESULTS.md`
- All cached layers (L1–L3 warm) are 1,000–100,000× faster than cold paths
- L2 `enrichRowsWithExpressions` is the bottleneck at 100k rows (381 ms cold / 0.003 ms warm)
- L5 aggregation under 20 ms at 100k rows; A1 `buildQueryDescriptor` under 2 ms with 50 filters

### UX-06 · localStorage persistence with Reset button (BL-90)

- Both `x-studio` and `x-studio-composed` now auto-save studio config to `localStorage` on every state change (1 s debounce), so layout and widget configuration survives page reloads
- On mount, saved state is restored via `deserializeState(saved, liveDataSources)` — data rows are never persisted; only pages, widgets, filters, relationships, and expression fields
- A **Reset to demo** toolbar button (`RestoreIcon`) clears localStorage and reloads the page, restoring the built-in demo configuration
- x-studio key: `'x-studio-state'`; x-studio-composed key: `'x-studio-composed-state'`

### UX-07 · Field picker: alphabetical sort + clear icon (BL-92, BL-93)

- `DataSourceFieldSelect` now sorts options by `(sourceLabel, label)` using locale-aware comparison so grouped options appear in a consistent alphabetical order regardless of insertion order
- When a value is selected, the Autocomplete's popup chevron is replaced by a visible × clear icon (`CloseIcon`), making it immediately obvious that the selection can be cleared
- Both the `fieldsProp` (static fields list) and `dataSources` (multi-source) code paths receive the same sort

### UX-08 · SetupSection shared section component (BL-94)

- New `SetupSection` component (`packages/x-studio/src/StudioComposeDrawer/SetupSection.tsx`) wraps a section with a `<Divider>`, a caption-weight heading, and an optional description paragraph
- Replaces ad-hoc `<Divider>` + `<Typography variant="caption">` patterns in `ChartSetupPanel`, `KpiSetupPanel`, and `GridSetupPanel`
- Props: `title`, `description?`, `dividerMb?`, `children?`

### UX-09 · Canvas DnD drops between and after widgets (BL-95)

- Root cause: `RowResizeHandle` (`position:absolute; z-index:20`) was a sibling of `InsertionPoint` inside the gap box, so drag events fired on the handle but never reached the `InsertionPoint` listener
- Fix: new `WidgetGap` component owns the gap box and registers `onDragOver`/`onDragLeave`/`onDrop` at the container level where events bubble from all descendants including the resize handle
- Drop indicator is rendered inside the container at `z-index:30`, above the resize handle
- `contains(relatedTarget)` guard in `onDragLeave` prevents indicator flicker when the cursor moves between child elements

### UX-10 · 24-column widget resize grid (BL-96)

- `GRID_COLS = 24` constant replaces the previous hardcoded `12` in `StudioCanvas.tsx`; `MIN_SPAN = GRID_COLS / 4 = 6` sets the minimum widget column span
- Matching `GRID_COLS` / `MIN_SPAN_COLS` constants added to `StudioController.ts`
- All flex/width calculations, grid-line positions, overflow checks, and default span calculations updated to use `GRID_COLS`
- `setAdjacentWidgetColSpans` clamp updated from `[3, 9]` to `[MIN_SPAN_COLS, GRID_COLS − MIN_SPAN_COLS]` = `[6, 18]`
- Finer 24-col grid gives more layout precision (smallest snap unit = 4.17% of row width)

### UX-11 · Nested feature flags for kpi/chart/grid (BL-100)

- **Breaking change**: flat per-widget feature flags (`kpiSparkline`, `kpiTrend`, `kpiTarget`, `kpiCalculatedFields`, `chartAnnotations`, `chartCalculatedFields`, `gridGroupBy`, `gridSummary`, `gridConditionalFormats`, `gridCalculatedFields`) removed from `StudioFeatureFlags`
- `kpi`, `chart`, and `grid` now accept `boolean | KpiFeatureFlags | ChartFeatureFlags | GridFeatureFlags`:
  - `kpi: false` — disables KPI widget kind entirely (unchanged behaviour)
  - `kpi: { sparkline: false, trend: false }` — KPI enabled, sparkline and trend disabled
- New sub-flag interfaces `KpiFeatureFlags`, `ChartFeatureFlags`, `GridFeatureFlags` exported from the package
- `useStudioFeatures()` now returns `ResolvedStudioFeatures` (flat booleans); internal consumers (`GridSetupPanel`, `KpiSetupPanel`, etc.) unchanged
- `resolveSubFlag<T>()` helper handles the `boolean | object | undefined` union cleanly
- `FeatureFlagSettings` component in `x-studio-shared` updated to read/write the new nested structure with helper functions `isKindEnabled`, `getSubFlag`, `setSubFlag`

### UX-12 · DnD cursor, grab offset, and transparency (BL-101)

- **Grabbing cursor**: added global CSS rule `body.x-studio-dragging-widget * { cursor: grabbing !important }` (via MUI `GlobalStyles` in `StudioCanvas`); class is toggled on `document.body` in `dragstart`/`dragend` handlers — eliminates the cursor flickering to `+` or `default` as the pointer crosses insertion points or resize handles
- **Correct grab offset**: `handleMouseDown` records the click position relative to the element in `dragOffsetRef`; `handleDragStart` passes this as the `setDragImage(node, offsetX, offsetY)` offset so the ghost card appears grabbed from where the user clicked rather than from the top-left corner; also eliminates the "white bar above widget" artefact
- **Card transparency**: `requestAnimationFrame`-deferred `opacity: 0.4` is applied to the original card element _after_ the browser captures the ghost image — the ghost stays fully opaque (visible drag feedback) while the in-place card fades, making nearby insertion points visible
- **Move semantics**: `effectAllowed = 'move'` on drag source; `dropEffect = 'move'` set in all `dragover` handlers (`InsertionPoint`, `WidgetGap`)

### UX-13 · Custom widget support (BL-99)

- **New types**: `StudioCustomWidgetDef`, `StudioCustomWidgetProps`, `StudioCustomWidgetSetupPanelProps` added to `models/customWidgetTypes.ts` and exported from `@mui/x-studio`
- **Registration API**: `<Studio customWidgets={[...]} />` accepts an array of `StudioCustomWidgetDef`; each entry registers a `kind` string (namespaced custom identifier), a `component` to render on the canvas, an optional `setupPanel` for the compose drawer, plus metadata: `label`, `description`, `icon`, `requiresDataSource`, `defaultConfig`
- **`StudioCustomWidgetDef.kind`** must not collide with built-in kinds; `BuiltinStudioWidgetKind` literal union is exported for exhaustive checks
- **Widget picker** (`AddWidgetView`): custom widget types appear below built-in types; `requiresDataSource` controls whether the "no source" warning blocks creation
- **Canvas rendering** (`StudioWidgetCard`): custom widget `component` renders inside the card with the same deferred-content skeleton as built-ins; also shown in the expand dialog
- **Compose drawer** (`StudioComposeDrawer`): if the widget's kind has a registered `setupPanel`, it is mounted in the Setup tab alongside built-in panels; consumers call `useStudioController()` and `controller.updateWidgetConfig(widgetId, { customConfig: { ...changes } })` to persist config
- **`useCustomWidgetMap()`** hook exported — returns a stable `ReadonlyMap<string, StudioCustomWidgetDef>` for O(1) lookup; rebuilds only when registered kinds change
- **`createDefaultWidget`** updated to accept an `overrides` object instead of a `StudioDataSource` second argument; custom kinds receive `config.customConfig` seeded with `defaultConfig`
- **Example** (`examples/x-studio`): `AlertBannerWidget` + `AlertBannerSetupPanel` demonstrate the API — an MUI `Alert` whose title, message, and severity are configured via the compose drawer

### UX-14 · Non-editable field text selection disabled (BL-102)

- Added `userSelect: 'none'` to `Typography` elements for physical field rows, expression field rows, and section headers in `StudioDataDrawer/DataSourceSection.tsx`
- Prevents accidental text selection when clicking or dragging labels in the data drawer

### UX-15 · DataDialog scrollable (BL-104)

- Changed `overflow: 'hidden'` → `overflow: 'auto'` in the `DialogContent` of `examples/x-studio-composed/src/components/DataDialog.tsx`
- Data source dialog now scrolls when the content exceeds the dialog height

### UX-16 · Drag ghost without action overlay (BL-105)

- Widget drag ghost is now a `cloneNode(true)` of the card, positioned off-screen (`position:fixed; left:-9999px`)
- Action overlay (`[data-widget-overlay]`) hidden in the clone via `querySelector` before `setDragImage` call
- Clone gets `opacity: 0.4`; original card stays fully opaque so nearby insertion points are visible
- Clone is removed via `requestAnimationFrame` after the browser captures the drag image
- `data-widget-overlay` attribute added to both overlay Stacks in `StudioWidgetCardActionsOverlay.tsx` (edit mode and view mode)

### UX-17 · Drag type isolation; tab reorder off-by-one fix (BL-106)

- Canvas `InsertionPoint` (native DOM listeners) and `WidgetGap` (React synthetic events) now guard both `handleDragOver` and `handleDrop` with `Array.from(dataTransfer.types).includes('application/json')` — tab reorder drags can no longer activate canvas drop zones
- AppToolbar (both `x-studio` and `x-studio-composed`) sets `'text/x-studio-tab'` MIME type on tab `dragStart`; `onDragOver` and `onDrop` only respond when that type is present — widget drags cannot trigger tab reorder highlighting
- Fixed off-by-one in `handleTabDrop`: after `splice(tabDragIndex, 1)` removes the source tab, the remaining array is one element shorter, so `adjustedIndex = tabDragIndex < dropIndex ? dropIndex - 1 : dropIndex` corrects the insertion position
- `Array.from()` used throughout for cross-browser safety (`DOMStringList` in older Safari lacks `Array.prototype.includes`)

## 📋 Planned

_Nothing remaining — all tracked requirements are complete or WONTFIX._

## 🚫 WONTFIX

### W-15 · Per-widget chart palette override

- App theme sets chart colours globally; per-widget override adds complexity for minimal benefit

### C-07 · Row management + layout picker

- Canvas row management via drag-and-drop and reorder (C-08) covers the primary use case; a separate layout-preset picker adds limited additional value

### A-06 · Multi-user / permissions

- Out of scope for a component library; consumer applications implement their own access control
